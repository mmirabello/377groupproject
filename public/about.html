    <h1>Information Problem</h1>
    <p>We found that there is an issue in the way the location and ranges of speed cameras are communicated to the public. We believe that anyone who commutes to campus or drives around the PG county area should care about this problem. No one enjoys
      getting speed camera tickets and our solution of showing people their location through our web app would help to cut back on their chances of getting one. Speed cameras are also generally placed around schools, and maybe making people aware of
      their location will help prevent speeding in these areas, a benefit to everyone.</p>

    <h1>Audience</h1>
    <p>We are currently marketing our program to residents of the Prince Georges county area, or people frequently traveling through. As well as University of Maryland students ho may be new to the area. In the future we hope to expand and cover more
      counites as time goes on.</p>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>The information problem is that unless you are very familiar with an area, there is no way to check to see where speeding cameras are. There are plenty of signs that suggest that an area’s speed limit is “photo enforced” but there is no way to
      actually know if this is true or not. One can use apps like Waze, but those generally provide an alert about cameras as one is nearing the camera. Our system would solve this problem by having a platform where people would be able to locate the
      speed cameras on their route beforehand, as well as the range to which they will ticket.We also have included a heat map to allow people to seee areas where speed cameras are particularly common. As a result, one would be able to mentally
      prepare to slow down around certain areas on his/her route.</p>
