I Am Speed - PG Speed Camera Locator

This website and application aims to help residents of PG and UMD students identify the locations of speed cameras in the county. We use data from Prince George's County's database to put markers on a map, and use heatmaps as a visual aid to show concentrations of cameras in certain areas.
