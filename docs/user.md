The purpose of this application is to inform UMD students with the locations of speed camera traps around the PG County area. UMD students should check the application before they leave to remind themselves of the location of the speed traps. With this information in mind, they can reduce the possibility of getting a ticket. The heatmap provides a visual aid to show the concentration of speed traps which should aid the students by showing them the areas in which more cautioned driving is required.
